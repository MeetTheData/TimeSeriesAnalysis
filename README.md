# TimeSeriesAnalysis
Time series analysis is a method for analyzing data in order to spot trends and predict what will happen in the future. I will carry out time series analysis on two types of data i.e. seasonal and non-seasonal data. This project will provide a procedure to analyze and fit a time series model in R. Part A covers analysis and forecast of ClosingPrice of Schodinger Stock Data. Part B covers analysis and forecast of Catfish Sales in United States. The data comprises of catfish sales on monthly level. Iâ€™ve followed the Box-Jenkins approach in the project in order to fit an appropriate time series model.
